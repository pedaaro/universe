# Universe SQL Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a SQL database named "universe" to store information related to astronomical objects and celestial phenomena. The project is inspired by FreeCodeCamp.org, and I followed their instructions to design and set up the database.

## Project Structure

- The database includes multiple tables capturing information about planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial entities.
- Each table is designed to hold specific attributes related to the respective astronomical objects.
- Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints are implemented to maintain data integrity.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Creation:**
   - Established a PostgreSQL database named "universe."

2. **Table Definitions:**
   - Implemented tables such as "planets," "stars," and "galaxies" according to the provided instructions.
   - Applied primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure accurate and reliable data storage.

3. **Data Insertion:**
   - Employed various methods to insert data into the tables, adhering to the specified data structure.

## Instructions Source

This project is based on instructions provided by FreeCodeCamp.org. I followed their guidelines to create the "Universe SQL" database, focusing on astronomical objects and their properties.
